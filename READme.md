## Overview

This is a photography website that focuses on the Front End development. I designed and created this website using CSS, HTML and Javascript.



## My process
- Planning
Since this is a mock up website, I decided to make a photography website about travelling, commercial photography and more.

- Design / Content
 I wanted to make a website that is simple but with accents of vibrant yellow-orange colours. Then, I decided the layout of the website, pages and what images I am going to use. 

- Coding
After knowing what message I want to convey and collecting images that align with it I started the coding process. Making sure it is responsive in diffent screen size

- Review
- Launch
 




### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Javascript


### What I learned
While making this project, I learned more about the impoertance of the design aspect of making a website. This is also my first time applying what I learned about CSS animations . I definitely need to work on it more but I'm happy with how it came out.


### Continued development

I want to focus on improving my CSS animation skills and learn other JavaScript frameworks. This is the line up of my next learning goal:
- ReactJS
- jQuery (I learned this before but I need a more in depth knowledge)
- NodeJS
